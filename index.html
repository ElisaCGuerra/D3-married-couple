<p>The story begins with 6 inseparable children (Leo and Lea, Louis and Louise, Charles and Charlotte.)
<br>One day, on their way home after a long day of school, they saw a white otter next to the river. As soon as she saw them, she ran away, and plunged right into the water, leaving behind her a subtle diamond dust. <br>The kids were so intrigued they decided to follow her.</br></br>
<br>Clearly, they ad to cross the river too. But none of the kids knew how to swim. Luckily, there was an old wooden boat they could use. Due to the small size of the boat, only two kids could be on it at the same time.</br>
<br></br>
<br>They need your help !</br>
<br></br>
<br>Place the kids ont the boat so they can cross the river. The thing is, the girls cannot stand being away from their brothers, but the brothers don't mind being seperated from their sisters. The boys cannot stand to see their sisters with another boy, if they're not present.</br></p>
