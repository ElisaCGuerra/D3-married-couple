    <h1>WELCOME</h1>
    <p>The story begins with 6 inseparable children (Leo and Lea, Louis and Louise, Charles and Charlotte. </p>
  <p> One day,on their way home after a long day of school, they sax a white otter next to he river. As soon as she saw them, she ran away, and pluged right into the water, leaving behind her a subtle diamond dust. The kids were so intrigued they decided to follow her.</p>
  <p>Clearly, they had to crow the river too. But none of the kids knew how to swim.
  Luckily, there was an old wooden boat they could use.</p>
  <p>Due to the small size of the boat, only two kids could be on it at the same time.</p>
  <p class="help"> They need your help!</p>
  <p>Place the kids on the boat so they can cross the river. The thing is, the girl cannot stand being away from their brother, but the brothers don't mind being separated from their sisters. But in the return, the boy cannot stand to see their r sisters with another boy, if they're not present.  </p>
